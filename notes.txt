AUTHENTICATION
--------------
In angular
  if !authorized:
    pop up a window to get a key
    enter username & password to hit
    a key endpoint.

  when we get the key, use that in 
  the resource declaration (param defaults)

In the api
  keys module
    Add a key endpoint that issues keys
    based on whether a correct u/p was sent (POST)
  todos module
    before each api method, authenticate the key sent.

To make it so users didn't have to log in all the time,
You could use sessions in rails on the angular app.  Authenticate to
the api with Rails, then pass that key to your angular app.
